# ue4-smartphone

Please note that working with this system requires at least intermediate knowledge of Blueprints


A fully tweakable smartphone with features straight out from AAA titles (taking photos, calling, mailing, messaging, music listening, etc.) and even more. There are plenty of tiny little details that will make your in-game smartphone as realistic as possible: a notification system, notification center where you can also put any widget you like (weather forecast, music player widget, etc.), smooth page scrolling, battery usage (optional) and apps search.

You will have 9 apps from the box: Messages, Phone, Maps, Mail, Camera, Gallery, Notes, Music, Settings and it is very easy to create your own apps, because any Widget Blueprint inside UE4 can be used as an app!
